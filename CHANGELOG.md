# Changelog

## v0.3.0 (2026-05-26)

Synchronized multi-package release. The `flopscope-server` and
`flopscope-client` packages are published to PyPI for the first time,
versioned in lockstep with `flopscope`.

### Added

- `flopscope[server]` extra: `pip install "flopscope[server]"` installs
  both flopscope and flopscope-server, exact-pinned to the same version.
- `flopscope-server` first PyPI release. Server-side runtime for the
  client/server architecture; pulls in flopscope as a dependency.
- `flopscope-client` first PyPI release. Lightweight drop-in replacement
  for `flopscope` that proxies all calls to a flopscope-server over
  ZMQ + msgpack. No numpy dependency; meant to be installed *instead of*
  `flopscope` in participant environments.
- Runtime version handshake between client and server: the first
  request from a flopscope-client to a flopscope-server compares
  versions and raises `ConnectionError` with both versions on mismatch.

### Changed

- `flopscope.__version__` now reflects the synchronized release line
  (still suffixed `+np<numpy_version>`).
- `flopscope-server`'s `flopscope` dependency is now an exact pin
  (`flopscope==0.3.0`) so server and library always travel together.

### Tooling

- Commitizen `version_files` is configured to update all version
  strings across the three packages in one `cz bump` invocation,
  including the cross-package pin.
- New `scripts/check_version_sync.py` and `make check-sync-versions`
  catch drift in CI before merge.
- `.github/workflows/pypi-publish.yml` is now a matrix workflow:
  one `v*` tag triggers three parallel builds, three parallel
  publishes (gated by a single `pypi` environment approval), and one
  GitHub Release.

## v0.2.0 (2026-05-26)

First PyPI release.

Flopscope is a NumPy-compatible math library that counts every FLOP
analytically, so compute budgets stop being guesswork.

### What's included

- 508 NumPy-compatible operations with analytical FLOP cost formulas
- Symmetry-aware einsum cost model (direct-event α/M)
- Orbit-mapping cost model for reductions (`sum`, `mean`, `median`, …)
- Configurable FMA cost convention (1 op vs 2 op)
- Budget tracking via `flopscope.BudgetContext` with namespaces and
  per-operation breakdowns
- Symmetric tensor support via `flopscope.as_symmetric`
- Bilinear-wrapper symmetry propagation (`matmul`, `dot`, `outer`,
  `inner`, `vdot`, `tensordot`)
- Public inspection helpers: `einsum_accumulation_cost`,
  `reduction_accumulation_cost`, `tier2_reduction_cost`

### Release tooling

- Commitizen for version bumps + CHANGELOG management
- Conventional-commits enforcement via a `gitlint` `commit-msg` hook
- PyPI publishing via Trusted Publishing (OIDC, no API tokens stored)
- Auto-created GitHub Release on every tag push

See the [README](README.md) for the API overview and the
[docs site](https://aicrowd.github.io/flopscope/) for guides and the
full API reference.
